Demo code from SecDSM talk about using Selenium to test darkweb credentials against a web login

There are two scripts. 

`test.py` is my first demo script.

`test_slow.py` is the same script but deliberately slowed down so you can better follow what the script is doing.

Both scripts use a local static website that just uses JavaScript to simulate the existance of a back end that is doing authentication.

## requirements

Need Selenium installed. I've included a `requirements.txt` to help with that.

I'm using Firefox so you must also have Firefox installed.
